This is an example streamlit dashboard demonstrating the collection of library operational data for monitoring and analysis.
It collects data from Alma, ArchivesSpace, and some Google Sheets representing gate counts and Illiad transactions.
The data structures are often quite specific to one institution, particularly where Alma data is concerned.
This repo is posted mainly for demonstrative purposes. It could potentially be adapted for use at other institutions, but not without significant revisions.
If there is sufficient interest, I can expand this readme to include instructions on how you might rework this dashboard for use at a different institution.
